# (1) Does this code run without error? If so, what does it produce? If not, explain why.  
# 
# 
# 

# In[1]:


x = [1, 2, 3]
y = 'bootcamp'
z = x + y


# The code has a run-time error because you cannot concatenate a string and a list. 

# (2) For the same x and y as the previous question: What function tells us what type they are? What function tells us how many elements they contain?

# The type() function can tell us what type each of them are and the len() function can tell us how many elements they contain. 

# (3) What type is each expression? How can you tell?

# In[ ]:


2 #Integer 
'2' #String 
2.0 #Float
"2.0" #String 
2 > 1 #Boolean 
'Itamar' > 'Chase' #Boolean
[1, 2] #List 
(1, 2) #Tuple 
{1: 'one', 2: 'two'} #Dictionary 


# For each case, you can tell by either identifying them directly or using the type() function if unsure. 

# (4) What value does each of these comparisons have?

# In[8]:


1 >= 0 


# In[9]:


1 >= 1 


# In[10]:


1 > 1 


# In[11]:


1 == 1 


# In[12]:


1 == 1.0


# In[13]:


'Spencer' == "Spencer"


# In[14]:


2**3 > 3**2 


# In[15]:


1 >= 0 or 1 <= 2


# In[16]:


1 >= 0 and 1 <= 2


# Noteworthy to consider the last two cases. When using "or", if you have at least one true boolean, Python will respond with True; contrast this with "and",where both arguments must hold true.  

# (5) Does this code run without error? If so, what does it produce? If not, how would you fix it? 

# In[18]:


if 2 > 1:
    print('Yes, 2 is still greater than 1')


# The code has no error and prints the given function since the argument is true. 

# (6) What is the result of running this code? Why?

# In[19]:


if True: 
    print('on the one hand')
    
else: print('but on the other hand')


# Python automatically prints the if statement rather than the else statement because we have not specified a prior argument for Python to evaluate and thus the default is shown to be True.

# (7) What is the result of running this code?

# In[22]:


cond = True 
if cond: 
    x = 'Chase'
else: 
    x = 'Dave'
print(x)


# (8) Suppose we have two lists, x = [1, 2, 3, 4] and y = ['x', 'y', 'z']. Adapt the code below to determine which has more elements: 
# 

# In[23]:


x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
y = ['x', 'y', 'z']

if len(x) > len(y): 
    print ('x has more')
else: 
    print('y has more')


# (9) Explain in words what slicing does. 

# Slicing allows us to access the individual elements in a string or list and manipulate them by specifying the item number in brackets. Note: Python starts forward counting with the number zero. Why? Beats me. 

# (10) How would you extract ("slice") the first element (the integer 1) from the list x below? The last element? All but the last element?
# 
# x = [1, ,2, 3, 4, 5]

# In[27]:


x = [1 ,2, 3, 4, 5]
print(x[0])
print(x[-1])
print(x[1:-1])


# (11) Use slicing to extract each word from 
# 
# sentence = 'This is a sentence; please slice it.' 

# In[38]:


sentence = 'This is a sentence; please slice it.'

print(sentence[0:4])
print(sentence[5:7])
print(sentence[8:9])
print(sentence[10:18])
print(sentence[20:26])
print(sentence[27:32])
print(sentence[33:35])


# (12) Consider the list 
# 
# x = [1, 2, "a", 'b', "fast", 'slow', 3, "Raghu", 'Liuren', 10] 
# 
# a. How would you slice out the first item? The last item?
# 
# b. How would you slice out the items from 'b' to 3 inclusive?

# In[57]:


x = [1, 2, "a", 'b', "fast", 'slow', 3, "Raghu", 'Liuren', 10]

print(x[1:])
print(x[:-1])
print(x[0], x[-1])


# (13) Using the same list x, write a loop that prints every element on a new line.

# In[58]:


x = [1, 2, "a", 'b', "fast", 'slow', 3, "Raghu", 'Liuren', 10]

for items in x: 
    print(items)


# (14) *Challenging.* Using the same list x, write a loop that prints every element of type str.

# In[62]:


for items in x: 
    if type(items) == str:
        print(items)
    


# (15) Use Spyder's help to find out what the range function does. How would you describe range(3, 12, 2)? Verify by converting to a list with list(range(3, 12, 2)).
# 

# In[63]:


get_ipython().magic('pinfo range')


# Based on Spyder's description, the range function returns an object that produces a sequence of integers that are inclusive of start and exclusive of stop in the format range(start, stop[, step]). Start defaults at 0 and step specifies the increment of the integers. 
# 
# Hence, range(3, 12, 2) should give us a list of numbers from 3 ascending in increments of 2 to 11. Let's verify:  

# In[67]:


list(range(3, 12, 2))


# Looks good! 

# (16) *Challenging.* Write a loop that sums the integers from zero to thirty that are multiples of three: 3, 6, etc. 

# In[88]:


x = range(0, 31, 3)
print(list(x)) # Just to make sure we have all our numbers.

total = 0
for num in x: 
    total = total + num
    
print(total)


# *Easier way to calculate the sum of x:* 

# In[86]:


x = range(0, 31, 3)
print(sum(x)) 


# (17) Define a function pocket_change() that takes four integers as inputs (numbers of pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters in your pocket) and returns a floating point number (their dollar value). Run your program with the input (1, 2, 3, 4). *Bonus (optional):* Report the value with a dollar sign. 

# In[97]:


def pocket_change(p,n,d,q):
    value = 0.01*p + 0.05*n + 0.1*d + 0.25*q
    print("$" + format(value,".2f"))
    
pocket_change(1, 2, 3, 4)


# (18) *Challenging.* Write a function notsix() that takes a list of integers and returns a (shorter) list of only those that do not begin with a 6. Test it on the list [1234, 6783, 6, 4321, 9876]. 

# In[120]:


def notsix(x): 
    answer = []
    for num in x: 
        if str(num)[0] != "6":
            answer.append(num)
    print(answer)
            
print(notsix([1234, 6783, 6, 4321, 9876]))


# (19) *Challenging.* Explain what this code does. 

# In[102]:


old_list = [1234, 6783, 6, 4321, 9876]
new_list = [x for x in old_list if str(x)[0] != "6"]
print(new_list)


# This code uses list comprehension to accomplish the same task we attempted in Question 19 by converting values in old_list to a string and using slicing to determine if the first character is a 6 and removing them from new_list. 

# (20) Consider the Python object 
# 
# z = {1: 'one', 2: 'two', 3: 'three'} 
# 
# a. What kind of object is z? What is its length?
# 
# b. Which components are keys? Which are values? 
# 
# c. How would I get the value associated with the key 2?
# 
# d. Use Spyder's help facilities to figure out what z.keys() does. Ditto z.values(). Try them to verify. 
# 
# e. What does list(z.keys()) do? 
# 
# f. What does list(z.values()) do?

# In[109]:


z = {1: 'one', 2: 'two', 3: 'three'}
z[2]


# In[127]:


z.keys()


# In[128]:


z.values()


# In[129]:


list(z.keys())


# In[130]:


list(z.values()) 


# a. z is a dictionary with length 3. 
# 
# b. The keys are the integers 1, 2, and 3. The values are the strings 'one', 'two', and 'three'. 
# 
# c. You can type z[2] to get the value associated with the key 2. 
# 
# d. The z.keys() function gives us a list of the keys that are within the dictionary z. z.values() gives us the corresponding values in z. 
# 
# e. list(z.keys()) gives us the keys in z as a list. 
# 
# f. list(z.values()) gives us the values as z in a list.
